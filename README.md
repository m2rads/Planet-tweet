# Tweeter-World
AR Application that brings Tweeter to the real world
## What it does
This project is an AR application that allows users to visualize tweets in the real world by placing them in their corresponding geographical locations.
The application uses the location data from the tweets, along with the Unity engine, to position the tweets in 3D space and display them as interactive 
objects. Users can move around the tweets and see them from different angles, and even interact with them by reading their text or clicking on links.
The project aims to bring tweets to life in a new and engaging way, allowing users to explore and discover tweets in a more immersive and interactive way.
